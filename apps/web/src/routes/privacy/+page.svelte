		<h1>The Fine Print</h1>

		<p>
			We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this
			privacy policy (“Policy”). This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from
			you or that you may provide (“Personal Information”) on the <a href="https://combine.social"
				>combine.social</a
			> website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively,
			“Services”), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that
			Personal Information. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your
			Personal Information and how you can access and update it.
		</p>

		<p>
			This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and
			Borch-Andersen ApS (“Borch-Andersen ApS”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this
			agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the
			authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or
			“your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree
			with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and
			use the Website and Services. By accessing and using the Website and Services, you acknowledge
			that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy
			does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals
			that we do not employ or manage.

		<h2>Collection of personal information</h2>

		<p>
			You can access and use the Website and Services without telling us who you are or revealing
			any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual.
			If, however, you wish to use some of the features offered on the Website, you may be asked to
			provide certain Personal Information (for example, your username).
		</p>

		<p>
			We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account,
			or submit any forms on the Website. When required, this information may include account
			details (such as username, unique user ID, name of server etc).
		</p>

		<p>
			You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able
			to take advantage of some of the features on the Website. Users who are uncertain about what
			information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.
		</p>

		<h2>Privacy of children</h2>

		<p>
			We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you
			are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Website and
			Services. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal
			Information to us through the Website and Services, please contact us to request that we
			delete that child's Personal Information from our Services.
		</p>

		<p>
			We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to
			help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information
			through the Website and Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and
			legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary precautions to ensure that
			their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information when online without their
			permission.
		</p>

		<h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>

		<p>
			We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information, unless we
			have entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data
			controller and we would be the data processor.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information.
			We act in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal
			Information that is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Website and Services. In
			such instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes and means of the
			processing of Personal Information.
		</p>

		<p>
			We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information
			through the Website and Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the
			submitted Personal Information, and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance
			with your instructions. In such instances, the User providing Personal Information acts as a
			data controller.
		</p>

		<p>
			In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we
			may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the
			information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or
			services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
			<li>Run and operate the Website and Services</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and
			Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have
			given your consent for one or more specific purposes; (ii) provision of information is
			necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual
			obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
			which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public
			interest or in the exercise of obcial authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for
			the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us.
		</p>

		<p>
			Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to
			such processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal
			bases. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
			processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or
			contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
		</p>

		<h2>Managing information</h2>

		<p>
			You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal
			Information you can delete may change as the Website and Services change. When you delete
			Personal Information, we will in short notice delete all Personal Information from our
			records. If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your
			account, you can do so simply by deauthorising the application in your list of authorised
			applications in your Mastodon Account.
		</p>

		<h2>Disclosure of information</h2>

		<p>
			We will never share any of your information with any of our our abliates, contracted
			companies, and service providers (collectively, “Service Providers”). We will not share any
			personally identifiable information with third parties and will not share any information with
			unabliated third parties.
		</p>

		<h2>Retention of information</h2>

		<p>
			We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary as long as your user
			account remains active, to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer
			retention period is required or permitted by law.
		</p>

		<h2>Links to other resources</h2>

		<p>
			The Website and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by
			us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other
			resources or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Website and
			Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect
			Personal Information.
		</p>

		<h2>Information security</h2>

		<p>
			We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment,
			protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative,
			technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use,
			modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in our control and custody. However, no
			data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.
		</p>

		<p>
			Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i)
			there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii)
			the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you
			and the Website and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may
			be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.
		</p>

		<p>
			As the security of Personal Information depends in part on the security of the device you use
			to communicate with us and the security you use to protect your credentials, please take
			appropriate measures to protect this information.
		</p>

		<h2>Data breach</h2>

		<p>
			In the event we become aware that the security of the Website and Services has been
			compromised or Users' Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a
			result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we
			reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to,
			investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement
			authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected
			individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the User as a result of
			the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will post a notice on the
			Website.
		</p>

		<h2>Changes and amendments</h2>

		<p>
			We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Website and Services at
			any time at our discretion. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this
			page, post a notification on the main page of the Website. We may also provide notice to you
			in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact information you have provided.
		</p>

		<p>
			An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the
			revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Website and Services
			after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will
			constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your
			Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time your
			Personal Information was collected.
		</p>

		<h2>Acceptance of this policy</h2>

		<p>
			You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By
			accessing and using the Website and Services and submitting your information you agree to be
			bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this Policy, you are not
			authorized to access or use the Website and Services.
		</p>

			If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints regarding this Policy, the information we
			hold about you, or if you wish to exercise your rights, we encourage you to contact us using
			the details below:
