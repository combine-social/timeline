# Combine.social timeline frontend

The web frontend for combine.social timeline app authorization.

## Developing

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set the "Buy me a coffee" link appropriately 
(consider pointing it to the buymeacoffee.com link seen in the footer of 
[combine.social][https://combine.social] to support the original developer).

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

See the build instructions in the [root readme](../../README.md).
